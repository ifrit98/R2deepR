R2deepR is an R package designed to make the lives of Deep Learning practitioners a little more conveneint.

## Features
  - Feature Scaling
  - Custom callbacks (lr_history, save_optimizer_weights)
  - Fully Preprocessed keras datasets (mnist, imdb)
  - Novel activation functions (brelu, gelu, belu, nalu)
  - Novel layers (Residual, GLU, PRU, Antirectifier, Autoencoder)
  - Learning Curve Plots (Training set size, batch size, learning rate)
  - Learning rate range test (see: Smith et al.)
  - One Cycle Learning Rate Policy (see: Smith et al.)
  - Evalation tools (F1 score for binary classifiers)
  - Assorted utility and convenience functions 
  - Weight activation curves (WIP)
